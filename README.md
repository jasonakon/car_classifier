## Introduction:
This project inspired by Grab “AiForSea”, Computer Vision challenge to classify and recognise distinct car images based on a given dataset. Here, car make and models can be classified immediate with any input images that belong to the provided car class dataset family which are 196 in total. This project uses a lightweight model that allowed to produce faster result and accurate result at the same time.

Thank you for giving such opportunity and let’s get ready to classify!
<br />
## Dependencies:
You’ll need have the following installed:
<br />
•	Python3
<br />
•	Opencv
<br />
•	Tensorflow v1.13 (latest-recommended)
<br />
•	Pillow
<br />
•	Numpy
<br />
•	CSV
<br />
•	Windows/Ubuntu
<br />
## Trained Model:
Model can be found at: “car_classifier/object_detection/trained_model/grab_model/”
<br />
## How to?
Head into working directory: “car_classifier/object_detection/”:
<br />
Then, this project provides 3 different methods of classification based on your input preferences:
<br />
### Method 1: Classify and view (images):
This method allows you to view the output generated from the model through a simple GUI:
